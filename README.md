### Example Request
**POST /auth/login**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword123"
}
```

### Example Response
**200 OK**
```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

### Example Request
**GET /users/{id}**
```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### Example Response
**200 OK**
```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "created_at": "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

The API uses JSON for both requests and responses, ensuring consistency and ease of use. Authentication typically requires a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.
## Authentication

To authenticate requests, include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header of each request. Tokens can be obtained by logging in through the **POST /auth/login** endpoint. Example:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Ensure the token is refreshed before it expires to maintain access.

## Error Handling

The API provides structured error responses with relevant HTTP status codes. Common errors include:

- **400 Bad Request**: The request is invalid or missing required parameters.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid request data."
  }
  ```
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication failed or token is missing/expired.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid or missing authentication token."
  }
  ```
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Resource not found."
  }
  ```
- **500 Internal Server Error**: A server-side error occurred.
  ```json
  {
    "error": "An unexpected error occurred."
  }
  ```.

## Usage Limits and Best Practices

### Usage Limits
- The API enforces rate limits to prevent abuse: **100 requests per minute** per user.
- Exceeding the limit will result in a **429 Too Many Requests** response.

### Best Practices
- Use caching for GET requests to reduce unnecessary API calls.
- Handle token expiration gracefully by refreshing tokens as needed.
- Monitor API usage and optimize requests to stay within rate limits.
- Validate input data on the client side to minimize errors.
